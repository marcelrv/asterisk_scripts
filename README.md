after_alarm_event.php  - Script to use for Asterisk to mimic a alarm center service. This script can dail your phone, send messages (email, sms MQTT, whatsapp) for certain alarm events. This way you can avoid expensive alarm centers and save phone cost

To use this, connect your Alarm to a VOIP ATA instead of a regular phone. Run Asterisk (e.g. on simple hardware like a Raspberry PI with raspbx (http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/) or e.g. on a Synology NAS) and configure Asterisk according the instructions.
